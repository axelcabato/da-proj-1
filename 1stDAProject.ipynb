    "In conclusion, the typical gym member is a moderately aged adult, centered around 39 years old, who achieves a consistent performance baseline during workouts, characterized by a steady session duration averaging 1.26 hours and a predictable energy expenditure of approximately 905 calories. This population exhibits a healthy cardiovascular profile, with Resting BPM tightly distributed around 62 beats per minute, confirming the overall fitness level; however, the significant positive skew and high range observed in Weight (from 40 kg to 129.9 kg) isolates a vital minority cohort whose specialized physical needs deviate sharply from the average, requiring tailored high-impact or low-impact programming. Ultimately, the tight clustering of core metrics (Age, Heart Rate, Session Duration) suggests that intensity and individual physiology are the primary drivers of performance variation, not simply time spent exercising."

Furthermore, the commitment profile is strongly anchored in sustainability, with almost 70% of members consistently engaging in a moderate schedule of three to four workout days per week. This widespread moderate commitment, combined with the fact that 80% of the population is classified as Beginner or Intermediate, establishes a clear, unified market vulnerability that necessitates immediate investment in standardized, supportive programming for novice retention."

    "2. **Workout Type vs. Calories Burned**\n",
    "    - The analysis reveals that High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) yields the highest average calorie burn (926 kcal), subtly surpassing traditional Strength and Yoga regimens, thus challenging the market's assumption that traditional steady-state Cardio is the most calorically effective workout.\n",

    "The bivariate relationships conclusively demonstrate that workout output is governed by a simple Duration-Intensity-Result model, where time commitment is the highest correlator of calories burned, while a strong negative correlation links high energy expenditure to lower body fat. The data further reveals that market demand is optimized by higher-burn workouts like HIIT and Strength training, signaling a shift away from traditional Cardio as the presumed calorie king, and that Experience Level serves as the most pronounced differentiator in both duration and resulting energy output. This disparity presents a unified and lucrative market opportunity to design progressive training programs that systematically bridge the 74% gap between Beginner performance and Advanced member retention."

This process ensures all variables are ready for potential use in machine learning models, preventing potential issues with feature bias and performance."
